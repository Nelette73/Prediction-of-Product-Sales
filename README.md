## Exploratory Data Analysis

 - There is a strong positive correlation between the outlet's sales and the item's listed price.

## Summary
- The R^2 value indicates how well the independent variables influence the dependent variables i.e. how well the model fits the data.
- Both training and test data has an R^2 value over 50% which means that the model performs above average (60.9% [Train] and 60.4% [Test]).

- The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metric is a simple metric that provides a straightforward interpretation of the modelâ€™s overall average error between the predicted and actual values.

- When comparing the performance on the training to test datasets we can say that no significant over/underfitting is noticable due to both MAE, RMSE and R^2 values that seems to be inline.
